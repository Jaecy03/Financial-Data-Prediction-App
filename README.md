# Financial Data Prediction App

This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing financial data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and engineering features for predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main components:

### Main Directory
- `Task 3 - feature_engineering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing feature engineering processes
- `generate_features.py`: Python script for generating features from the dataset
- `simple_feature_analysis.py`: Python script for basic feature analysis
- `feature_engineering_summary.md`: Summary of the feature engineering process and findings
- `clean_data_after_eda.csv`: Cleaned dataset after exploratory data analysis
- `engineered_features.csv`: Dataset with engineered features
- `feature_correlations.csv`: Correlation matrix of features
- `price_data.csv`: Financial price data

### EDA Directory
- `EDA_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis
- `Task 2 - eda_starter.ipynb`: Starter notebook for EDA tasks
- `Data Description.pdf`: Documentation describing the dataset
- `client_data.csv`: Raw client data
- `price_data.csv`: Raw price data

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing financial data to identify patterns and relationships that can be used for predictive modeling. The workflow includes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data structure, identifying patterns, and cleaning the dataset
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance
3. **Feature Analysis**: Analyzing the importance and relationships between features

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
- Data visualization libraries (likely Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies (requirements.txt to be added)
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the analysis process
4. Execute the Python scripts for specific feature engineering tasks

## Future Work

- Implement machine learning models using the engineered features
- Optimize feature selection for better model performance
- Expand the analysis to include additional financial metrics
